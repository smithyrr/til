# TIL <!-- omit in toc -->

A collection of small snippets of mostly technical stuff that I learn and get back to regularly. Though, this repo feels more like a Note to Self than a collection of snippets.

_14 TILs and counting..._

## Inspiration <!-- omit in toc -->

I got the inspiration for this from [Josh Branchaud](https://joshbranchaud.com/)'s repository [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). I first read about the idea of documenting what I learn in [Shawn Wang](https://www.swyx.io/)'s blog [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).
